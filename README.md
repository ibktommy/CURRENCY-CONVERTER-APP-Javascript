<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/ibktommy/CURRENCY-CONVERTER-APP-Javascript/blob/master/screenshot.png)<br><br>

<li> This is a Currency Converter Application that I created using HTML/CSS/JS. The Javascript in the code is what makes the App functional.</li>

<li> In the App, I make use of Javascript FETCH API and also ASYNC-AWAIT. I have comment out the 'Fetch API codes' to use the Async-Await codes</li>

<li> I did this project so as to test my skills and knowledge mainly on Javascript call to API using "Fetch" and "Aync-await"</li>

### Built With

## Challenges Faced and Solved

<!-- List the problems encountered during the development of your application -->
<li>Beginning this project, the first challenge I was faced with was how to get the API access keys and include it in my code. I watched some tutorials and I went on to register on the API website to get free access keys that has a limit of 100 requests per month.</li>
<li>The second challenge which really took me up to 2 hours was the mathematical calculations involved during the conversion from one currency to another. I googled some conversion method but I didnt really get it so I had to get a Pen and Paper and work it out myself and after some trials, I was able to get bring up a standard formula.</li>
<li>The third challenge was deciding how to detect and handle errors in the application. I was able to set the error display message to situations whereby at least one of the input field is empty and also when the currency code typed is wrong</li>
<li>The fourth challenge was how to make sure that the currency code entered by the user is changed to uppercase as the currency codes are in uppercase format json data of the API</li>
